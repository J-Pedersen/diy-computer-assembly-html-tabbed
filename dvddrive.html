      <h4> Dvd Drive </h4>
      <p> Optical Drives really only differ by what types of media they can handle and whether or not they can read and write or just read the media. </p>
      <p> The cost of Optical drives has dropped to the point where it is a very minor purchase so if you are going to buy one for your system then I would say a read/write model is going to be what you want because the price difference is so small. </p>
      <img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 25px;" src="images/dvd-small.png" alt="An image of a dvd writer." title="A DVD Writer">
      <p> The different types of media they can handle are CD, DVD, and Blu-ray. </p>
      <p> A DVD writer will run somewhere in the 15 to 40 dollar range. </p>
      <p> If your purchasing one from somewhere that is charging more than 40 dollars for it then you need to go somewhere else because their prices have a huge markup and you could save money somewhere else not just on this DVD drive but most likely on all the components you want to buy from them. </p>
      <p> If their prices are over inflated on an optical drive I would guess that everything is so just take your money somewhere else or buy your parts from a reputable online store that may or may not have an egg in the name or possibly a zon at the end. </p>
      <p> you might have to wait a few days for your parts by purchasing them online but you will get the best deal you can by going that route. </p>
      <p> A Blu-ray writer should run anywhere between 60 and 100 dollars if it is more than that again go somewhere else. </p>
      <p> Physical media is quickly becoming obsolete so not having an optical drive at all in your computer is possible. </p>
      <p> However you may find yourself in need of one at some point so if you are going to forgo installing one I would recommend you but an external optical drive that you can connect via a USB just in case you happen to need it down the road. </p>
      <p> They are relatively inexpensive say in the 30 to 40 dollar range for one that just handles CDs and DVDs. </p>
