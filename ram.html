      <h4> Ram </h4>
      <p> Ram or Random Access Memory most commonly referred to as a memory module comes in a lot of different types. <br>
        Most recent computers will use one of the types that I list on this page. </p>
      <br>

      <img style="float: right; margin: 15px 25px 15px 0px;" src="images/memorydesktop-small.png" alt="An image of a stick of desktop ram." title="A DDR3 Desktop Memory Module">
      <h4>Desktop Memory</h4>
      <p> The most common and most recent iteration of memory modules for desktop computers is DDR. <br>
        DDR comes in types 1 thru type 4. <br>
        If your computer was built in the last 10 years it will almost certainly have DDR. <br>
        If your computer in the last 5 years it will most likely have version 2 or 3 DDR. <br>
        If your computer was made in the last year it will most likely have ddr 3 or 4. <br>
        To know for certain which type it has or can use you should either refer to the motherboard specs or manual. <br>
        Or shut your system down, unplug your PC from the wall and remove a ram module from your motherboard as it will have exact type listed on it. <br>
        Motherboards can be very particular about which type, speed and voltage ram modules it will except so make sure to do your research before you make a purchase or you could find that it doesn't work. </p>
      <img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 25px;" src="images/memorylaptop-small.png" alt="An image of a stick of laptop ram." title="A SO-DIMM Memory Module">
      <h4> Laptop Memory </h4>
      <p> A laptop computer will most likely use some type of DDR SO-DIMM which is specific to laptop computers and some small form factor computers use it as well such as the Intel NUC PCs. <br>
        SO-DIMM memory modules can come as multiple different types and have different voltage requirements so make sure you research what type your laptop or mini PC needs before you buy. </p>
      <br>
      <p> PROTIP: DO NOT TRY TO ADD OR REMOVE YOUR RAM WHILE YOUR SYSTEM IS PLUGGED IN. </p>
      <p> I have had people come to me to fix their systems before because they tried to hot swap their ram. <br>
        Don't do that. <br>
        Just don't. </p>
      <p> Removing or adding a stick of ram to or from your motherboard while it has power   will fry either your ram, your motherboard or both so always unplug your computer if you are working inside it.<br>
        Even if you are just cleaning it. <br>
        It is better to be safe than to have to replace hundreds of dollars worth of parts because you were careless. </p>
