      <p>Have wished you had the know how to build your own desktop computer, media pc or server?<br>
        <br>
        Have you ever had a computer break down and known what was broken but had to take it to <br>
        be repaired because you didn't know how to fix it yourself?</p>
      <p>This web site is designed for solving exactly those two issues.<br>
        <br>
        In the sections on this web site you will find a detailed description for every main           component <br>
        in a personal computer.<br>
        <br>
        All of the steps necessary to build a PC from individual components as well as steps to remove <br>
        and replace the damaged parts in a   broken PC are listed in each  components section.</p>
      <p>The Primary components of any home computer, media pc or server are:</p>
      <img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 25px;" src="images/cases-tiny.png" alt="An image of some computer cases." title="Computer Cases">
      <h4>The Case</h4>
      <p>Every Computer will have some form of enclosure and each one is different in some ways and
        similar in others.</p>
      <br>
      <img style="float: right; margin: 15px 25px 15px 0px;" src="images/motherboard-tiny.png" alt="An image of a motherboard." title="A Motherboard">
      <h4>MotherBoard</h4>
      <p>All Computers have a main circuit board this is referred to as a "motherboard".<br>
        Motherboard can come in many sizes.</p>
		<br>
      <img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 25px;" src="images/cpus-tiny.png" alt="An image of some cpus." title="CPUS">
      <h4>CPU</h4>
      <p>The CPU or central processing unit is the brain of any computer.<br>
        Every computer will have a CPU.<br>
        <br>
        In the earlier days these CPU chips were soldered into the motherboard and required a lot of technical knowledge to replace them.<br>
        CPUs on modern computers are in lock into motherboards with a mechanism referred to as a socket. </p>
      <img style="float: right; margin: 15px 25px 15px 0px;" src="images/memorydesktop-tiny.png" alt="An image of a set of ram modules." title="DDR2 Memory Modules">
      <h4>Ram</h4>
      <p>Ram or Random Access Memory is the short term memory of all computers.<br>
        Commands and data are stored in Ram as requested for use by the computers CPU.</p>
      <br>
      <img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 25px;" src="images/hdd-tiny.png" alt="An image of an hdd." title="HDD">
      <h4>HDD</h4>
      <p>HDD or Hard Disk Drive is the storage space of your PC.<br>
        Most modern PCs will have an HDD or and SSD which is a Solid State Drive.<br>
        <br>
        An SSD serves the same function as an HDD only data can be accessed much faster with an <br>
        SSD than it can be with an HDD.<br>
        An SSD uses flash memory to store data and has no mechanized parts where as an HDD uses <br>
        platters that spin up or spin down based on the systems current workload.</p>
      <img style="float: right; margin: 15px 25px 15px 0px;" src="images/videocard-tiny.png" alt="An image of a graphics card." title="Graphics Card">
      <h4>Video Card</h4>
      <p>Video Graphics Cards are common in most home computers.<br>
        Your computer may or may not have one.<br>
        If your computer is not set up as a Gaming PC it may instead have some form of integrated graphic
        such as an APU which is both a CPU and an integrated graphics chip     combined into one.</p>
      <br>
      <img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 25px;" src="images/dvd-tiny.png" alt="An image of a dvd drive." title="Optical Drive">
      <h4>Optical Drive</h4>
      <p>Most Computers will have an optical drive such as a cd or dvd burner however your PC may not.<br>
        <br>
        It is becoming more and more popular to have a PC lacking an optical drive because it uses physical media such as a dvd disk.<br>
        Almost everything you use or media you consume on your PC will be from a download or streaming <br>
        service of some kind thus the need for an optical drive is rapidly being eliminated.</p>
      <br>
      <img style="float: right; margin: 15px 25px 15px 0px;" src="images/atxpsu-tiny.png" alt="An image of an atx power supply." title="Power Supply">
      <h4>PSU</h4>
      <p>A PSU or Power Supply Unit is in every computer in some form or another.<br>
        They can come in many shapes and sizes but they all serve the same function and every computer will have one.<br>
        A PSU supplies the Motherboard and all the drives such as HDDs and Optical Drives with power.<br>
        Failure of your PSU is the most common reason why a computer wont turn on or wont stay running<br>
        and thus it is one of the first things to test when you have a broken PC in many cases.</p>
